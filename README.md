# the-universe

I want to create a  react app that represents/visualizes the known universe from the largest scale to the smallest scale.
I want to make an interactive experience where the user will be able to interact with things like planets, atoms, dna, galexies etc
and get information about them

An ambitious project, dont know how far I will go

Trying my best XD
